## Suggestions / Pull Requests

We welcome suggestions for the website, in particular new items in the Papers, Resources, and Projects pages.

### How to proceed?

* The simplest way to get started is by adding a file to the `suggestions` folder (e.g. in `txt` or `md` formats), then [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). We will then add content to the appropriate pages.

* If you are more familiar with website structure, you can also insert the content on your own. Edits are performed from the [source](https://github.com/tpchina/tpchina.github.io/tree/source) branch of the repository. The files are located at:

  - `_bibliography/*.bib`: catalog of research papers.

* Suggestions can also be raised in the [Issues](https://github.com/tpchina/tpchina.github.io/issues) page.
